# Slices and segments

Slices are the second level in the organizational hierarchy of Feature-Sliced Design. Their main purpose is to group code by its meaning for the product, business or just the application.

Segments are the third level in this hierarchy, and their purpose is to group code by its technical nature.

## Dividing by slices

Since each layer has semantic meaning, it helps to keep that meaning in mind to understand how the code should be divided by slices. Also remember the [import rule on layers][layer-import-rule] that states that one slice cannot import modules from another slice on the same layer. This rule will ensure that your slices are highly cohesive (which is good).

### Entities

Every slice should be devoted to a single entity. A good starting-off point is to use database entities (table names) from the backend as the main entities for the app, however, entities are not only limited to database tables.

For example, the podcast player _Cast_ (see it in [project examples][examples--cast]) contains an `audio` entity which represents a concept from the technical vocabulary, but does not correspond to a database entity.

### Features

A single action, either done by the user or by the app on their behalf, can represent a single slice. When there are many related small actions, they can be grouped together to keep the slices clean.

For example, for a photo gallery app, creating an album, renaming an album and sharing an album can be grouped into a single slice `album`, but uploading photos and editing them could be placed into separate slices, `upload-photo` and `edit-photo` respectively.

### Widgets/Pages

A single widget/page usually deserves its own slice, however, in the same way as with features, several widgets that are closely related to a single entity can be grouped together.

### Other layers

For layers that are little concerned with business logic, division by slices is unnecessary, which is why layers Shared and App usually consist directly of segments.
